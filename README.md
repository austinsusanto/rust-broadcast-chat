# Reflection

## 2.1. Original code of broadcast chat.

![Broadcast chat server & 3 clients](assets/1.png)
In this test, we can see the original server and client program. The server program is run first and the client program is run afterwards. Everytime a new client connects to the server, the server will show a new connection message. The client also has the ability to type a message. The message the will be sent to the server and the server forwards it to the other clients.
